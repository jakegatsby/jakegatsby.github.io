    <p>On display are medals that go back to the North West Rebellion of 1885 and the South African Wars. The single medal on the left, the North West Canada Medal, a campaign medal, was awarded to Gunner E.D. Burling, an original member of the Winnipeg Field Battery which helped in actions against the Northwest Rebellion. The first commanding officer of the 99th Manitoba Rangers, LCol F.J. Clarkâ€™s picture and medals are to right. The centre photograph shows LCol E.A.C. Hosmer, first commanding officer of the XII Manitoba Dragoons (seated beside LCol F.J. Clark). His military medals are above the photograph. On the far right are a picture and medals of LCol R.P. Cromarty, the first commanding officer of the 26th Field Brigade Royal Canadian Artillery. Some of these medals were purchased and others donated. Many medals, pins and badges, generously donated by individuals and families, are located in the top two drawers.</p>
